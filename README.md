# Quiz
A brief coding quiz to practice Javascript!
In the index file, my main focus was adding the div's for the different elements in the quiz, namely the container, the timer, the score, and the various buttons. I practiced using ID's instead of just classes so I could manipulate them easier in the JS file.


The Javascript file contains a variety of functions, but the main three are controlling the timer, controlling the score, and controlling which buttons can be seen by the viewer at a particular time.
